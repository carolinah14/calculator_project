# Calculator (Python)

A Python console-based calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. The program allows users to continuously calculate using previous results or start a new calculation, implementing the use of recursion, functions, dictionaries, loops, and program flow control.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Ensure both files are in the same folder:

   calculator.py  
   art.py

4. Open a terminal (or your preferred Python IDE).
5. Navigate to the folder containing the files.
6. Run the script using:

   python calculator.py

7. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Writing and calling functions
- Functions as values stored in a dictionary
- Using dictionaries to map operators to functions
- Loop control with `while`
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`)
- Recursive function calls to restart the program
- User input handling and type conversion (`float`)
- Maintaining and updating state across iterations
- Importing ASCII art from another file
- Console-based user interaction
